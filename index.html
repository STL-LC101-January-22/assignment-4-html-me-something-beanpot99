      I learned to juggle around four years ago. I always have preferred to unicycle over juggling so I was resistant to learn for many years. Once I finally decided to learn, it took me another year to learn to pass juggle clubs and another two years to pass well enough to perform. Currently I am trying to juggle three spinning plates with two sticks while they are still spinning. I have been working on this trick since the fall with almost no progress!

        Unlike juggling, I have been unicycling for well over 15 years. My dad always knew how to unicycle and offered me $50 if I could ride to the end of the block. It remained a fun activity that my dad and I both enjoyed. In high school we both began to mountain unicycle (riding the unicycle on mountain bike trails). It wasn't until college that I began to work for my current agency and started to earn money from unicycling. Every year around christmas you can find me riding around various events in Saint Louis dressed as an elf!

        In regards to my circus-related hobbies, stilt walking might be the most over-rated. Stilt walking is the most visually eye-catching and so it is by far the most popular product at events. In addition to my regular (peg) stilts which give me around 5 feet of added height, I also do jumping stils. Jumping stilts gigs are by far my favorite gigs to do and they are essentially two pogo sticks strapped to my legs. To date I have had countless stilt costumes at countless events but my favorites are definitely my horror clown and robot-alien costumes which were both at Ballpark Village. The worst part about walking on stilts is forgetting you have crazy makeup on and pumping gas after an event and then making awkward eye contact at the pump with someone.

        One of my favorite non-circus hobbies is rock climbing! While I love climbing in an indoor gym, my favorite places to climb are all outdoors. Some of the best climbing in the midwest is actually only 2 hours south of the city in southern Illinois! Within the sport of climbing there are two types: bouldering, and sport climbing. Bouldering is essentially (like the name implies) climbing boulders, or closer to the ground problems without the use of ropes. The individual moves you make are much harder but the route overall is shorter. Sport climbing, on the other hand, is climbing tall cliff faces or walls and most definitely requires the use of a rope. My favorite type of climbing is by far sport climbing and the best route I have ever climbed is a route named 'Loving Lizards'!.

        One of the main reasons that I love to run is to eat great snacks along the way. I have a fanny pack which only has the purpose of holding my skittles. I am by no means a fast runner, but instead like to run slowly for a very long time. My biggest running accomplishments to date are a marathon and an olympic distance triathalon. The best race I have ever participated in was a half marathon in Memphis which had a snack tent at EVERY half mile marker. The problem was that I consumed enough beer, donuts, candy and bagels to cancel out the health benefits of running the race.

      My love of hiking has very similar origins to my love of running which is the abundance of snacks consumed on hikes. Two summers ago, my boyfriend and I summited Long's Peak in Colorado. We had to start hiking around 2 am and didn't get back to our car until 4pm which allowed for PLENTY of snacking opportunities (most noteably an entire package of mint oreos at the top).

        I don't actually LOVE camping and would choose my actual bed over a tent any night of the week. However, camping is often required to allow for my other hobbies to take place and therefore decided to consider it a hobby. The first image above is my cat, Olive. When I first got her, we spent an entire year trying to take her camping and backpacking with us. As you might expect, it failed rather miserably as Olive is a cat. The other photo is of our 'adventure van' which is actually just my parent's old minivan with a raised platform and a mattress. Our van allows us to save on campground fees and camp either on the side of the road or parking lots (usually Walmart's),
